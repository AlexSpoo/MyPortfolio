          <p>
            Driven by a desire to continuously learn and grow, 
            I find joy in collaborating with like-minded individuals to bring ideas to life. 
            I am currently pursuing my studies in Computer Science and Design at Munich University of Applied Sciences 
            and I am eager to apply the theoretical knowledge and practical skills I've gained thus far in a real-world setting.
